                    <p>
                        I used to work in the field of telecommunication more than 10 years, holding various positions (call-center, marketing) and a variety of duties. At present moment I started working in a new sphere of professional activity for me - insurance company.
                        Some time ago I made a decision to switch my professional sphere drastically, and so started attending an online course in web-development. While studying there we were mastering to build responsive web-sites using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, also learning basic JS and creating some simple apps. But I quite.
                        And now I decided to start from the scratch again and continue learning.
                        I want to be proficient in technologies mentioned below and to expand the range of them. So I’m here at RS School (it’s my second shot and hope the final:)) and ready to get solid knowledge required to start a career path in Front-end development.
