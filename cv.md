### Profile summary

I used to work in the field of telecommunication more than 10 years, holding various positions (call-center, marketing) and a variety of duties. At present moment I started working in a new sphere of professional activity for me - insurance company. 

Some time ago I made  a decision to switch my professional sphere drastically, and so started attending an online course in web-development. While studying there we were mastering to build responsive web-sites using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, also learning basic JS and creating some simple apps. But I quite.

And now I decided to start from the scratch again and continue learning. 

I want to be proficient in technologies mentioned below and to expand the range of them. So I'm here at RS School (it's my second shot and hope the final:)) and ready to get solid knowledge required to start a career path in Front-end development.

### Code example

**Task from Codewars:** Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns “Even” for even numbers and “Odd” for odd numbers.

**Solution:** 

```script

function even_or_odd(number) {
    if (number%2 === 0) {
        return "Even";
        else {
            return "Odd";
        }
    }
}

console.log(even_or_odd(-3));
```
