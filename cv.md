### Profile summary

I used to work in the field of telecommunication more than 10 years, holding various positions (call-center, marketing) and a variety of duties. At present moment I started working in a new sphere of professional activity for me - insurance company. 

Some time ago I made  a decision to switch my professional sphere drastically, and so started attending an online course in web-development. While studying there we were mastering to build responsive web-sites using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, also learning basic JS and creating some simple apps. But I quite.

And now I decided to start from the scratch again and continue learning. 

I want to be proficient in technologies mentioned below and to expand the range of them. So I'm here at RS School and ready to get solid knowledge required to start a career path in Front-end development.
